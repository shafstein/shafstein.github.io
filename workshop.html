<p class="MsoPlainText" style=""><b style=""><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; color: black;">Many
systems in applications can be viewed as dynamical systems,
and researchers working in dynamical systems come from applied
mathematics,
engineering, informatics or other sciences. Algorithms for dynamical
systems
use a variety of mathematical methods from areas such as numerics,
approximation theory, optimization, graph theory and many more. Hence,
the
experts in central areas of dynamical systems, such as Lyapunov
functions, are
distributed amongst the different disciplines in science, but also
between
various mathematical areas. The exchange between these different
researchers
has not been established by usual conferences, which are normally
restricted to
one mathematical area. This workshop aims to overcome this lack of
communication by inviting researchers from different disciplines and
mathematical areas to exchange methods and ideas, and to facilitate new
collaborations. A particular emphasis is on the active participation of
young
researchers, to provide them with a forum of presenting their own
research and
to learn about new areas.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
